         * @param {Tween} tween The related tween instance.
         * @param {String} prop The name of the property being tweened.
         * @param {any} value The current tweened value of the property, as calculated by TweenJS.
         * @param {Object} startValues A hash of all of the property values at the start of the current
         * step. You could access the start value of the current property using
         * startValues[prop].

         * step.
         * @param {Number} ratio A value indicating the eased progress through the current step. This
         * number is generally between 0 and 1, though some eases will generate values outside
         * this range.

         * the target property.
